!!!About
An Ajax enabled online calendar. Drag and drop events to change dates, drag the start/end of an event to create multi-day events, create and edit events 
without refreshing the page, all with an iCal style interface.

This release now works in all major browsers (Firefox, Opera, Safari, and Internet Explorer). IE support still has a few bugs, namely the previous/next 
month links not working, and the need to click on a multi-day event before you can resize it.

!!!Demo
Try out the beta calendar [1]
Works in Firefox, Opera, Safari, and Internet Explorer (IE support is still buggy).

!!!Info
Monket Calendar is coded in HTML, CSS, Javascript, and PHP. It is based on the premise of providing an Apple iCal style interface that is available 
wherever you are. The interface has been designed to make it as easy as possible to add/change/remove events and thereby reduce the frustration of using 
the browser for entering and managing data.

The layout of the events is also important, Monket Calendar is one of the only web based calendars can displays multi-day events spanning accross the 
days on which they occur (Plans Calendar is the only other one I've seen). This spanning of events makes it much easier to read the calendar at a 
glance.

I made extensive use of exisitng libraries to speed up my development work, including:

    * PHPiCalendar [2] for parsing .ics files
    * DataRequestor [3] for Ajax calls
    * ie7 [4] for Internet Explorer compataibility
    * DOM-Drag [5] for javascript drag and drop support
    * DOM Tooltop [6] for javascript tooltip support

!!!Change Log
* Fixed incorrect reference to monket-cal-update.php in monket-cal/update/index.php (Thanks to Randall Blecher and Paul Adams for the heads 
up).


!!!Bugs/Missing Features
Monket Calendar is still in Beta, which means there are known bugs and missing features.

* Internet Explorer support is still poor. The prev/next month buttons do not work, and you must edit a multi-day event before you can resize it.
* You cannot change the colour/calendar of an event after it has been created.
* Resizing multi-day events causes a page refresh (should really be done with Ajax).
* The fade out at the bottom of each day is incorrectly positioned in Safari.
* In Opera creating/editing an event does not automatically focus the text field.
* Rounded corners only show up in Firefox.

!!!The Author
Monket Calendar was written by Karl O'Keeffe [9] (but couldn't have be written without the help of the authors of the libraries mentioned in the info 
section).

As of 25th June 2005 I am taking a year out to travel the world, so I will be unable to maintain Monket Calendar. If you are interested in taking over 
the project from me, conttact me by email [10]. I'll try and check my email at least once a week while trekking through Asia.

Upon my return I'll be looking for work in the Information Architecture/Interface Design side of IT. If you have anything that might interest me please 
let me know [10]. My CV is available online [11]

!!! License
Monket Calendar is released in two flavours.

One under the GPL [7] as a fully working PHP application using the PHPiCalendar project to parse the .ics files.

The second flavour is released under the Creative Commons 2.5 License [8] and does not include the GPL licensed PHPiCalendar. This flavour requires an 
alternate .ics parser (not included I'm afraid).

Monket Calendar can be used in commerical applications, but unless you ship your source code with the application you can only the Creative Commons 
licensed part. This is because PHPiCalendar is licensed under the GPL, which requires that you ship your source code with your project.

If your project is never released to the public (internal company project for example) than you are free to use the GPL code without having to make your 
changes public.
